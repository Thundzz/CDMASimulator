A C++ CDMA Simulator.

The goal of this simulator is to see the impact of using different kinds of binary sequences as spreading sequence for
asynchronous CDMA communications. The sequences used are generated either using chaotic maps (logistic map, piecewise linear map)
or are Gold sequences (generated thanks to LFSRs).

Feel free to use this if you need to.
